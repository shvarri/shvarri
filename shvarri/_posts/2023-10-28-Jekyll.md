## *What is Jekyll*

Simple, blog-aware, static site generator Jekyll is ideal for individual, project, or organization websites. Jekyll converts HTML and Markdown files into a fully static website based on the layouts you select. Markdown and Liquid, a templating language that loads dynamic content on your website, are supported by Jekyll.

##  *Pre-requisites to install*

### Jekyll Installation on MAC

In order to install Jekyll for macOS, Ruby needs to be installed with the version manager CHurby which can install multiple versions of Jekyll.

#### 1. To install Homebrew, enter the following in your terminal

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

```

#### 2. To install churby, enter the following in your terminal

```
brew install chruby ruby-install xz
```

#### 3. To configure your shell after installign churby

```
echo "source $(brew --prefix)/opt/chruby/share/chruby/chruby.sh" >> ~/.zshrc
echo "source $(brew --prefix)/opt/chruby/share/chruby/auto.sh" >> ~/.zshrc
echo "chruby ruby-3.1.3" >> ~/.zshrc # run 'chruby' to see actual version
```

##  *Installation of Ruby and Jekyll*

Install Ruby and run the *Ruby+Devkit 2.6.X (x64)*
[Ruby](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/)

#### 1. Quit and relaunch terminal and in order to se evrything working run the follwing

```
ruby -v
```

#### 2. Install the jekyll and bundler gems.

```
gem install jekyll bundler
```
#### 3. Create a new Jekyll site at 

```
myblog
```

#### 4. Change into your new directory
```
cd myblog
```

#### 5. Build the site and make it available on a local server.

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```


##  *Get started*

Your blog entries are stored in the _posts folder. Although HTML is available, Markdown is usually used for post writing.

<img src="/assets/lib/images/ss1 2.png" alt="ss1 2" style="max-width: 60%;" />

#### Add a file with the following format to your _posts directory in order to generate a post:

                    YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.md

#### Front matter, which is usually used to set a layout or other meta data, must come first in all blog post files. For a basic illustration, this can be left empty:

```
---
layout: post
title:  "Welcome to Jekyll!"
---

# Welcome

**Hello world**, this is my first Jekyll blog post.

I hope you like it!
```

#### Config.yml file:

Jekyll employs some parameters in the _config.yml file while processing your website. When creating a Jekyll site, default settings will be used in an empty configuration file. For example, Jekyll will utilize the kramdown Markdown filter automatically, so you don't have to specify it when converting Markdown to HTML.

#### You may utilize the assets folder to store photos and logos by making an images folder inside of it.
<img src="/assets/lib/images/ss2.jpg" alt="ss1 2" style="max-width: 60%;" />

<br>

#### Additional side bar categories may be added by adding them to the _tabs folder:

<img src="/assets/lib/images/ss3.jpg" alt="ss3" style="max-width: 60%;" />

#### Using the Jekyll template, this was how this Web page was created.
